**Hidden-Markov-Model**

**Mathematics behind HMM with code in R**

Problem Formulation -
The number of hidden states is unknown. K is the total number hidden states. We assume that given the hidden states 
![equation](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?Z_i) , 

![equation](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?P%28Y_i%7CZ_i%29+%5Csim+N%28%5Cmu_%7BZ_i%7D%2C%5Csigma%5E2_%7BZ_i%7D%29)

Generally for state-space modeling with unknown hidden states. Lets K = 2,3,4 or more. We are suppose to estimate suitable K.
