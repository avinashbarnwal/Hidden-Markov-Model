**Hidden-Markov-Model**

**Mathematics behind HMM with code in R**

Problem Formulation -
The number of hidden states is unknown. K is the total number hidden states. We assume that given the hidden states ![equation](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?Z_i) 

Generally for state-space modeling with unknown hidden states. Lets K = 2,3,4 or more. We are suppose to estimate suitable K.

Paramters to estimate
